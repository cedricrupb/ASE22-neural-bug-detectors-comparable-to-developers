export const VAR_MISUSE_DEFINITION = 'Variable misuses happen when a developer mistakenly uses a variable name, which does not fit its context. Therefore, watch out for variables that look â€žsuspicious" at a program location. Variable misuses can only be usages of variables, i.e. read accesses to variables.\n\n Keep in mind that in this study maximally one line can contain a variable misuse and there might be methods that do not contain variable misuse bugs at all.';
