# Figures 

This folder contains all figures from the paper as reported in the paper (hence including retries).  
Each file name corresponds to the numbering of the figures in the paper.

The figures are generated using the script `gen-paper-figures.ipynb`
in the folder `notebooks`.

The sub-folder `README.md` contains the figures without retires.
For more information see the [README](/NoRetry/README.md).
