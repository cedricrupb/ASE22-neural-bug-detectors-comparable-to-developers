# Figures without retries

This folder contains all figures from the paper **without retries**.  
Each file name corresponds to the numbering of the figures in the paper.

To compare the results with and without retries, we provide the document
`comparison.pdf`, that compares each figure side by side.
One can observe that there is nearly no difference in the figures and
that the findings stay valid, if the retires are not included!

The figures are generated using the script `gen-paper-figures-no-retry.ipynb`
in the folder `notebooks`.
